          |Using the 
          a(href='https://github.com/kruser/atbat-mongodb' target='_blank') atbat-mongodb
          |  project, we pull pitch and at-bat data from each day's baseball games and store
          | it in our own MongoDB database. This site differs from other PitchFX search sites
          | in that it front-loads most of the data for a player into your browser and lets
          | your browser do the work. This makes facetting much, much quicker.
        p
          |Data from each day will be available by 6AM EST on the following day.

          |Be sure to search first to make sure your issue doesn't already exist. If it does, feel
